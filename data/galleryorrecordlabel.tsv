"How did #Artemisia see herself?

Artemisia's repeated use of her self portrait in her paintings begins when she was 19. Possibly wanting to avoid the expense of hiring models, she may have started using herself as a model. 

Find out more with @googlearts: https://t.co/K1YRGWDMr1 https://t.co/dsBAJiVUV7"	0
Want to learn more? Our exhibition, 'Artemisia' is the first major exhibition of Artemisia’s work in the UK and it's now open until 24 January: https://t.co/bKci1emsT0 https://t.co/rnpqIhtKsD	0
The last 25 years of her life were spent in Naples, where she had established a successful workshop – an extraordinary achievement considering she wasn’t permanently employed at one royal court. https://t.co/GD5EPj7COl	0
She was a follower of Caravaggio, and, like her male counterparts, tackled big historical and biblical subjects, with her own distinct style. https://t.co/f22LANXzmY	0
Artemisia returned to Rome in 1620, by which point she had become an extremely sought-after artist with a “house full of cardinals and princes wanting pictures from her”. https://t.co/IccnwGTZoF	0
"Following the trial Artemisia married a little-known Florentine artist, and left Rome for Florence. 

There she had five children and established herself as an independent artist, becoming the first woman to gain membership to the Academy of the Arts of Drawing in 1616. https://t.co/t0genLj6oY"	0
While Artemisia’s personal identity is closely intertwined with her artistic production, there are many other experiences which shaped both her life and her art. https://t.co/daUOexb7ej	0
The story of her rape has defined the way art historians talk about Artemisia, especially the explicitly violent scenes in which a strong heroine is the main protagonist. https://t.co/1Fho82oXVw	0
"At the age of only 17, Artemisia was raped by the painter Agostino Tassi. There followed an infamous trial in 1612, in which Artemisia was subjected to gruelling questioning and torture. 

Tassi was found guilty, but his punishment never enforced. https://t.co/lDfzayqAUT"	0
"""The spirit of Caesar in the soul of a woman""

Born in Rome in 1593, Artemisia was brought up by her father, the painter Orazio Gentileschi. She trained alongside her three brothers in his workshop, where she proved the most talented of all his children. https://t.co/B1CGIB9lW0"	0

Caroline, Director of Collections and Research: Hard question! It changes every day. Today it's Degas's 'Combing the Hair'. It's such an everyday thing, made into art. I love the sensation of combing my hair, and Degas evokes this so wonderfully in red paint. #AskACurator https://t.co/RovrfKnhzu https://t.co/QPhOf3N3vr	0
"Lucy, our Dorset Curatorial Fellow: I don’t know if it counts as a ‘pun’ per say, but the name Artemisia (Gentileschi) literally translates as ‘art is me’. Gloriously appropriate.

@nejafeja @ArthistoryC Hi Julia, due to the way we have had to reorganise the Gallery we won't be able to honour reciprocal agreements for the foreseeable future. However, 'Titian' has been extended until January 2021 and we do hope that reciprocals will be back in place before then.	0
@nejafeja @ArthistoryC Hi Julia, we've just announced that we'll be opening until 6pm from Wednesday 22 July so more time slots have now opened up for 'Titian'! https://t.co/Mt0U8ZIEfL	0
Anthony van Dyck's 'Equestrian Portrait of Charles I' is now back on display in Room 21 after a king-sized restoration project. Watch how it took a small army of people to clean, repair and restore one of our largest paintings: https://t.co/ujUhGK2Yxg https://t.co/W0as6yYfCC	0

Sir Joshua Reynolds was born #OnThisDay in 1723. This painting of Lady Cockburn with her three energetic boys includes a macaw which is probably Reynolds’s own bird, hated by his housemaid but reportedly tame enough to perch on the wrist of his friend, Dr Johnson. https://t.co/aOkotqhEUM	0

@BattlementClare Hi Clare, thank you for tweeting this to us and please do thank Honor for such a great question. We aren't really sure why Titian decided to paint the sails white. He might not have known this part of the myth or he might have chosen to ignore this detail for some reason. (1/2)	0

Happy birthday to Rembrandt, born #OnThisDay in 1606. He painted more self portraits than any other 17th century artist and we have two of them in our collection.
