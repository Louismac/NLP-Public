    "    If you want to change the back and forth / gameplay dynamic, this happens in the ```generate_text()``` function. It generates some text and then delays for some time before the next turn. If you want to have rules that change over time, you can use the ```ctr``` variable. It goes up by 1 every iteration. You can run the cell underneath everytime to generate new text.\n",
